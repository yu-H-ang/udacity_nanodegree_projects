    "\n",
    "* Deadline: Since the variable deadline has so many differetn values, including it to build agent states would make the state space enormous and make the learning really slow. Even though it holds some value(we want the agent to reach destination as soon as possible), considering we need to let the agent learn sufficently within 100 trials, deadline is ignored in my model.\n",

    "* Traffic to the right: This doesn't affect how the smartcab excutes its action in all three different scenarios. (1)If traffic to the right is empty, clearly there is nothing to worry about. (2)If traffic to the right is proceeding straight or turning left, its traffic light must be green and therefore the light for the learning agent must be red. That means the smartcab can only turn right, then they won't interfere each other. (3)If traffic to the right is turning right, again the traffic doesn't affect our cab's action.\n",

Since we plan to run 100 trials, even though the smartcab reaches the destination before the deadline, the smartcab can at least learn over 1000 times. The state space is reasonable and the smartcab should be able to learn and make informed decisions about each state."

After updating the Q table for some time, the agent can take very smart actions and almost always reach the destination before the deadline.\n",
