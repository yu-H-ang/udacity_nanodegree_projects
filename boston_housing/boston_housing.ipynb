For MSE and MAE, by definition, MSE gives more weight to the data points further away from the mean, so the model optimizing MSE will be more sensitive to outliers.

The advantage of k fold cross validation is that it matters less how the data is split. \n",

    "# Analyzing Model Performance\n",
    "In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing error rates on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `max_depth` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects learning and testing errors. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

    "**Answer: The top-left one: max_depth = 1. Initially, the training error is tiny while testing error is huge. This happens because very small amount of data is given to the model to train, so it can almost memorize the training data. But the model is not trained enough, so it performs poorly on predicting unseen testing data. As the size of the training data increases, the training error increases while the testing error goes down very rapidly. In this period, more training data goes to the model so it gets better on predicting testing data. But since in this case the model is really simple, under-fitting happens, so the training error increases by a lot. The size of the training set keeps increasing, both errors stabilize. **"

The model with the smallest testing error is the best one that generalizes the dataset. Here both under-fitting and over-fitting are moderate, and the model has the best performance on predicting new data. From the graph above, the model with the smallest testing error is near  max_depth = 6. The models with max_depth equals 4 to 7 should all be a model that can make good predictions.**"

    "In this final section of the project, you will make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`. When applying grid search along with cross-validation to optimize your model, it would typically be performed and validated on a training set and subsequently evaluated on a **dedicated test set**. In this project, the optimization below is performed on the *entire dataset* (as opposed to the training set you made above) due to the many outliers in the data. Using the entire dataset for training provides for a less volatile prediction at the expense of not testing your model's performance. \n",

The approximate population in the Greater Boston area shown by the Google is 4.59 million, let's assume that all these people did at least one house trade in every 30 years. That means there are still hundreds of thousands of house trade happening each year. The samlpe size we used is only 506. I think this number is too small and the model we just built is not accurate enough to do a prediction on an area with such a big population. **"
