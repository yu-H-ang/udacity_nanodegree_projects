    "## Definition\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Inspired by Micromouse competition, this project is about programming a robot which can automatically explore a virtual maze and find the fastest way to reach the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "On each maze, the robot must complete two runs. The first run is an exploration. The robot is allowd to roam freely in the maze to not only find the goal room, but also to collect necessary information about the maze so that the robot can find a better path leading to the goal. In subsequent runs, the robot mouse is brought back to the start location. It must attempt to reach the center in the fastest time possible, using what it has previously learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "The robot’s score for the maze is equal to the number of time steps required to execute the second run, plus one thirtieth the number of time steps required to execute the first run. A maximum of one thousand time steps are allotted to complete both runs for a single maze."

    "## Analysis\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration and Visualization\n",
    "The maze exists on an n x n grid of squares, n even. The robot will start in the square in the bottom-left corner of the grid, facing upwards. The goal room, consisting of a 2 x 2 square, is located at the center of the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot has three obstacle sensors, mounted on the front of the robot, its right side, and its left side. Obstacle sensors detect the number of open squares in the direction of the sensor. The sensors will return the distance between the robot and walls in a list called ```sensors``` as in [left distance, forward\n",
    "distance, right distance].\n",
    "\n",
    "On each time step of the simulation, the robot may choose to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise ninety degrees, then move forwards or backwards a distance of up to three units. It is assumed that the robot’s turning and movement is perfect. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the robot tries to move into a wall, the robot stays where it is. After movement, one time step has passed, and the sensors return readings for the open squares in the robot’s new location and/or orientation to start the next time unit. The first maze(12 x 12) is plotted using the given python script ```showmaze.py```. The path from the starting point(left-bottom cell) to the goal room is shown by a series of red balls. There are acutally four shortest paths in this maze. The robot need to cross 30 cells to arrive the destination on them. Since our robot can move up to three cells per unit time, so the robot need to try to make as less rotations as possible to achieve a short time trip.\n",

    "<img src=\"maze_1_path.png\", width=400, height=400>\n",
    "<img src=\"maze_1_moves.png\", width=400, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the reason stated above, we only need to count part of the red balls. I marked those negligible balls as pink. So in total for this route, the robot need to take 17 movements to reach the goal room. This is acutally the optimal route in this maze. In some other routes, the robot need to take more rotations in its trip, which severely slowdown the robot. The two pictures below show a case like that, again I use the pink ball to mark those cells included in a robot's stride.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"maze_2_path.png\", width=400, height=400>\n",
    "<img src=\"maze_2_moves.png\", width=400, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "My robot is programmed based on flooding algorithm. The idea behind flooding algorithm is this: Imagine a maze has non-permeable walls and flat, level floors. If the robot turn on a hosepipe at the starting point of the maze, the water will start filling the maze. The below how shortest paths are found using this algorithm in a fully-known maze 1. The shortest route to the target destination will be taken by the first drop of water that arrives there.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fa.png\", width=400, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this algorithm, the robot is able to find the shortest path given the starting point and its destination, if it has accurate information about the maze. However, even though initially the robot knows nothing about the structure of the maze. It can still adjust its routes each time it collects some more information on the maze. The robot will get closer and closer to the goal room gradually and finally it will gets there and learns a lot of information about the maze. This is how the robot can explore the maze in the first run. To make sure the robot gets enough knowledge about the maze, the first run is divided into three phases in my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Firstly the robot will roam the maze, step by step, following the left wall. This strategy will give the robot a basic knowledge on the structure of the maze. If finally the robot get to the goal room, the phase 2 is skipped. If the robot get back to the starting point by only following its left wall, then the robot enters phase 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In phase 2, the robot will utilize the information collected in phase 1 to get to the goal room using flooding algorithm. During this process, the robot may touch some unknown area thus enrich its knowledge about the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this final exploration phase, the robot will try to get a 100% map coverage on the maze. It will again use flooding algorithm to reach every untouched cell. Once the robot remembers every inch of the maze, it can easily get to its destination on the shortest route generated by the algorithm. One problem about this strategy is that a 100% map coverage may not be necessary. In the later stage of phase 3, the robot will use lots of effort to get very tiny information about the maze, which may not be important for finding a shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the robot finish the exploration and the maze structure is well defined, it can easily find the shortest path leading to its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "If a robot can find the optimal path leading to the goal room by making less moves in the exploration run, it certainly should get a higher score. However, if a robot can save a significant number of moves by just making a little bit more steps in the second run, it still should get a high score.\n"

    "In the early version of this code, the robot was not programmed to try to get a full maze coverage in the exploration run. There was also three phases. But the difference is that in the 3rd phase, the robot did another left(or right) wall follower search instead of trying to reach every blind point in the maze. The old strategy could miss some important information in a larger maze. So the average performance for the 16 x 16 maze is not quite satisfactory. After that, I modified the 3rd phase so that the robot can learn all the maze structures."

    "Unlike the other three mazes, the robot can get to the goal room by just using a left-wall-follower strategy in the first run. So the phase two is automatically skipped by the robot. It directly enter phase three to get a 100% map coverage.\n",

    "The first challenge of this project to divide the whole problem into many small pieces. Unlike other projects before, in this capstone project, there is no clear thought about what I need to do or what steps I can take to finally solve the problem at the first place. The whole problem consists of many different aspects, like, how to explore the maze as fast as possible, how to find the best route, how to record what the robot have learnt from the sensors. I must think all of them through and step by step build the robot. And I have to make sure all my codes are correct before including some new features in the program, otherwise the debugging will be a mightmare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another chanllenge is to implement ```known_maze, coverage``` update mechanisms. Since all the other strategies or algorithms are based these two essential variables, so if there are some bugs in these parts, the robot will have some very strange behaviors. And that was what happened during the early stage of this project. Besides, the way we use binary number to record wall information also needs to be carefully dealt with.\n",

    "In a real micromouse competition, everything is in a continuous domain rather than a perfect virtual world. There everything has errors. The sensors mounted on the robot won't know exactly how many cells are open. Instead, it will only measure a distance value to any object ahead of the sensors. Additionally, the rotation and movement of the robot is no longer perfect. They are both continuous values and the robot can make mistakes. The accumulation of small errors can result in robot's losing its accuracy on exploring the maze. The robot speed also needs to be controlled. A fast movement can give the robot a higher score, but it can also increase the probability to make mistakes. In real world we don't deal with unit time, but real time. To get a higher score, challengers must try to shorten the time needed for every action the robot take. Of course, to build a real micromouse that can solve a maze, it is far more complicated than a virtual one. A real robot needs to be built. Chips, motors, sensors, memory, wheels, all of these must be tweaked to have a nice performance. There is just so many things to consider and we can't cover all of them here."
